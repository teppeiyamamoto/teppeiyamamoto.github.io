      <p><strong>Welcome.</strong></p>
      <img src="./pics/me.jpg", width=240 , alt="Me", align="right", style="margin:10px 10px">
      <p>I am a Professor at the 
      <a href="https://www.waseda.jp/fpse/en/">Faculty of Political Science and Economics</a> at 
      <a href="https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/">Waseda University</a>. 
       </p>
      
      <p> Before joining Waseda, I was a Professor of <a href="http://web.mit.edu/polisci/index.shtml">Political Science</a> at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a>, where I also directed <a href="https://pmlab.mit.edu/"> Political Methodology Lab (PML)</a> 
      at MIT's political science department. </p>
      
      <p> I obtained a B.A. in Liberal Arts from the
      <a href="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html">University of Tokyo</a> 
      (2006) and a M.A. (2008) and Ph.D. (2011) in 
      <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/politics/">Politics</a> from 
      <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/">Princeton University</a>, where
      I received a Charlotte Elizabeth Procter fellowship for the year of 2010
      to 2011. My doctoral dissertation won the John T. Williams Dissertation
      Prize in 2010 from the Society for Political Methodology. I also studied
      at Lincoln College, the University of Oxford, as a visiting student. </p>
      
      <p>I am broadly interested in the development of quantitative methods 
      for political science data.  My research has focused on statistical
      methods for causal inference, including causal attribution, causal mediation, 
      causal moderation, and causal inference with measurement error.
      I also study experimental designs and survey methodology, with empirical applications to 
      elections and comparative political behavior. </p>
      
      <p>My work has appeared in various academic journals, such as
      <a href="http://www.ajps.org/"><i>American Journal of Political Science</i></a>,
      <a href="http://www.apsanet.org/content_3222.cfm"><i>American
      Political Science Review</i></a>,
      <a href="https://amstat.tandfonline.com/loi/uasa20">
      <i>Journal of the American Statistical Association</i></a>,
      <a href="http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/">
      <i>Political Analysis</i></a>,
      and <a href="http://www.pnas.org/">
      <i>PNAS</i></a>. I have won several awards for my research and professional work, including the <i>Emerging Scholar Award</i> (2019) from the Society for Political Methodology. My work has been supported by the National Science Foundation. </p>
